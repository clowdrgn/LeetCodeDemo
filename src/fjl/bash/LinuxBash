How would you print just the 10th line of a file?

For example, assume that file.txt has the following content:

Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10
Your script should output the tenth line, which is:
Line 10

1:
sed -n 10p file.txt
2:
cat file.txt | sed -n 10p
3:
awk 'FNR == 10 {print }'  file.txt
4:
tail -n+10 file.txt|head -1
5:
head -n 10 file.txt | tail -n +10
